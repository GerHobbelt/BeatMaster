BeatMaster
==========

Minimal framework for when your DOM/UI/application performance is of utmost importance: it provides an 'animationFrame'-driven state machine to help you sequence, schedule and manage your application tasks. 

Use BeatMaster when MVC/MVP sounds nice but doesn't cut it helping you stay in control of your application and you want to be able to optimize it without losing your mind. BeatMaster will drive your slaves. 

Use BeatMaster when you feel your app can benefit from the characteristics of a 'game engine' while maybe not being a game itself.
